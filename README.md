# google-foobar
This repository contains the problem descriptions and solutions to the problems I encountered on  the google foobar challenge.

## About the challenge
This challenge gets triggered based on your search on google for computer science terms.
Once you accept the challenge, a terminal window opens on the browser and you could request challenges

There are 5 levels with increasing order of difficulty.

At the end, there is a base64 encoded string (a surprise) that needs to be decoded. The script for this is found in the **cryptography_challenge** folder.

The most challenging problems in this set (in my opinion) are

Level 3 - Doomsday Fuel

Level 4 - Running with bunnies

Level 5 - Expanding Nebula (The hardest of the three)

I highly recommend looking at these solutions for comparison pursposes and **not copy paste** it.

Have fun!
